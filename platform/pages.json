We specialize in high quality Staunton wood chess sets and our sales staff is familiar with all of the chess sets we sell. Everyone at The Chess Store has their list of favorite chess sets and boards and we're more than happy to share with you what we like about each one. New chess set designs are always in the works, from new traditional Staunton chess sets to antique reproductions.</font></font></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10\"><b><i><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Quality\nControl </font> </i></b><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">means you get the quality you expect and deserve! At The Chess Store, we inspect each and every chess piece before it ships out our door. If the quality does not meet our standards, the chess piece or entire chess set is rejected. We report every defect and problem back to our manufacturer and work to improve all aspects of the chess set and manufacturing process.</font></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10\"><font face=\"Arial\"><i><b><font size=\"2\">Customer\nService</font></b></i>  <font size=\"2\">  should be an important consideration in deciding where to buy your chess set. We get feedback from many customers that purchased chess sets from other online stores and unfortunately, much of it's not good. We hear some pretty sad stories, from terrible chess set quality to stores unwilling to even answer their phone and email. At The Chess Store, we stand behind our chess sets and we have live customer service to help you before and after you buy your chess set.</font></font></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10\"><b><i><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Amazing\nCraftsmanship </font> </i></b><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">are the two best words we can think of to describe the work that goes into making each and every chess piece. Our chess sets, side by side, dollar for dollar, are unmatched by any other brand.&nbsp; From the basic pawn to the most intricately carved knight, our manufacturer's skilled craftsmen and master carvers are the best in the world and you'll see it in the finished chess set!</font></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\"><b><i>In-house polishing </i></b>means you get the best finish possible on your chess set.\nNot to confuse you, our chess sets are beautifully polished when we get them,\nbut that's not good enough for us. We like to put each piece to the polishing\nwheel a final time after final inspection to make sure you get the best possible\nchess set. As far as we know, we are the only chess store doing this. It's more work and adds more cost, but second best is not good enough.</font></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10\"><font face=\"Arial\"><i><b><font size=\"2\">We are continuously striving for improvement</font></b></i><font size=\"2\">. Our chess sets are the best value anywhere, any brand. We've had customers compare our chess sets to other popular brands and ours win out most the time. We work closely with our chess set manufacturer to improve quality on every aspect of chess set design and manufacture. From the raw wood down to the final polishing process, we are continuously looking for ways to make the best chess sets in the world!</font></font></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10\"><font face=\"Arial\"><b><i><font size=\"2\">Packaging is important</font></i></b> <font size=\"2\"> to make sure you receive your chess set in perfect condition. We've seen how some stores package (or don't) their chess sets and it's not good. After final inspection, our chess sets are carefully packaged in either our black and gold box card board box or a sturdy white card board box for the larger sets. Our black and gold card board box has padding top and bottom and dividers to keep pieces safely apart. The more delicate pieces are wrapped in bubble for additional protection. The chess set box is then packaged in a larger packing box to make sure that our packages get to customers without damage 100% of the time.</font></font></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\">The Chess Store team is committed to providing our customers the best value in Staunton wood chess sets in the world. Every day we get emails from customers expressing their satisfaction and happiness with their chess set, and just as importantly, the customer service they received. Here's an excerpt from an email\nwe received from one our many satisfied customers:</font></p>\n<font SIZE=\"2\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 5\"><i><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Hello there!</font></i></p>\n</font>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5\"><i><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\">\nI ordered a set last week from your store and my sweetheart received it today. He was so happy with it and it really made his day. The set arrived on time (actually even earlier than I expected for Valentine's and that's wonderful!) and it came with a beautiful Hallmark's card which was a wonderful surprise! Its\ngot a personal touch to it as if I picked the card myself and as if the person who sent it knows us. I loved the way the card was handwritten and the little heart stickers that was put on the card. I really would like to thank the lady (I'm assuming its a lady) who took the time to pick the card and write my personal note on it. It was beautiful and I'm so touched. You've made my day and his. My sweetheart showed the set to me over his web cam and it looked great! He was extremely pleased with the superb quality of the set. It is so much more beautiful than what was shown on your website (though I was already impressed with the pictures). I picked your store instead of the other stores because I can see the quality of your product compared to theirs. Now that I've ordered it and seen the excellent service you provided, I'm never going elsewhere! =) I will definitely recommend your store to my friends and so\nwill my boyfriend (who happens to be a chess nut!) The smile and excitement on his face when he opened the box was priceless. I'd like to thank you again for\nthe beautiful set and the intricate personal service you offered that made our day.

Even though golden rosewood is relatively cheap, it's a very beautiful wood with gold-brown colors. We offer many chess sets in golden rosewood and we have combinations of golden rosewood with boxwood and also with ebonized boxwood for a unique combination. You will find just about any size you are looking for, from 2.75\" up to 4\" kings. These chess sets are either double or triple weighted, come with green baize pads, and include an extra set of queens for pawn promotion.\n"

Nearly all chess tournaments now use chess clocks to regulate the pace of play and they are being used more and more even in the casual game at home.<br>\n<br>\nChess clocks are divided into two general categories, the analog chess clock with two clock faces, one for each player, and the digital chess clock which usualy has two LED displays. Surprisingly, old fashion analog chess clocks continue to be very popular, primarily because they are easy to use and are very affordable. The digital chess clock offers precision, timing options, and other useful features that analog clocks simply can't provide. Digital clocks tend to be a little more expensive but there are some very good clocks at prices comparable to analog clocks.<br>\n<br>",

In 1849 Nathaniel Cooke, proprietor of the Illustrated London News, presented John Jaques a new and elegant design for chessmen that would later be endorsed by Howard Staunton, the first British chess World Champion. Howard Staunton was so impressed with the new design that he agreed to put his signature on every box of Jaques London chess pieces. To this day, Jaques London continues to produce some of the finest Staunton chessmen in the world."

Over the\r\n      past eight years our chess sets have been in several movies, television series,\r\n      commercials, and magazines. The award winning series House\r\n      on Fox made a large purchase of chess sets and boards that were used in an episode\r\n      that aired on May 15th, 2007. The\r\n      episode, The Jerk, was was based on a 16-year-old chess prodigy\r\n      suffering from intense head pain that came on after he attacked his\r\n      opponent during a speed chess tournament.</font></p>\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"600\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\">In\r\n      2006 one of our brass chess sets appeared in the movie X-Men, The Last Stand.

The President started two different chess games with his staff,\r\n      moving from room to room to make his moves, while at the same time dealing\r\n      with a serious international matter.

These chess rules are intended to help our visitors and customers  new to the chess game, get the chessboard setup correctly along with enough  instruction and knowledge of the chess rules to have a legitimate and enjoyable game. We hope you find them useful.</p>\n\n<div align=\"left\">\n  <table border=\"0\" width=\"650\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n    <tr>\n      <td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">\n        <p style=\"margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\"><b><font size=\"2\">Object\n        of the Chess Game</font></b></p>\n        <p style=\"margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\"><font size=\"2\">It's\n        rather simple, there are two players with one player having 16 black or\n        dark color chess pieces and the\n        other player having 16 white or light color chess pieces. The chess players\n        move on a square chessboard made up of 64 individual squares consisting of 32\n        dark squares and 32 light squares. Each chess piece has a defined\n        starting point or square with the dark chess pieces aligned on one side of the\n        board and the light pieces on the other. There are 6 different\n        types of chess pieces, each with it's own unique method to move on the\n        chessboard. The chess pieces are used to both attack and defend from attack,\n        against the other players chessmen. Each player has one chess piece\n        called the king. The ultimate objective of the game is to capture\n        the opponents king. Having said this, the king will never actually be captured. When\n        either sides king is trapped to where it cannot move\n        without being taken, it's called &quot;checkmate&quot; or the shortened\n        version &quot;mate&quot;. At\n        this point, the game is over.\n        The object of playing chess is really quite simple, but mastering this game of chess is a totally\n        different story.</font></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"650\">\n  <tr>\n    <td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5\"><b><font size=\"2\">Chess Board Setup</font></b>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\"><font size=\"2\">Now\n      that you have a basic concept for the object of the chess game, the next step is to\n      get the the chessboard and chess pieces setup according to the rules of playing chess. Lets start with the\n      chess pieces. The 16 chess pieces are made up of 1 King, 1 queen, 2\n      bishops, 2 knights, 2 rooks, and 8 pawns. From the following\n      diagram, you can identify the pieces and the general character of their\n      shape and appearance and also the location or square the chess pieces start\n      from according to the chess rules. Now the chessboard. The correct\n      orientation, as per the chess rules, is with a black square on your left side as facing the chess\n      board. One of the more common mistakes in setting up the chess board\n      is reversing the king and queen chess pieces. Remember, as per the chess rules, the queen is always on\n      her own color while the king is always on the opposite color.</font></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"650\">\n  <tr>\n    <td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">\n      <p align=\"center\" style=\"margin-bottom: 10\"><font size=\"2\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://static.zoovy.com/img/thechessstore/Bffffff/layoutwithpiecelabels.jpg\" alt=\"Chessboard setup - Rules of Chess\" width=\"475\" height=\"363\"></font></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"650\">\n  <tr>\n    <td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\"><b><font size=\"2\">How\n      the Chess Pieces Move</font></b></p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0\"><font size=\"2\">Now\n      that you have the chessboard setup with each piece sitting on its correct square,\n      you need to know the chess rules of how each chess piece moves.&nbsp; The following are diagrams\n      and instructions for the move of each chess piece.</font></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"650\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"325\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 5; margin-bottom: 10\"><font size=\"2\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://static.zoovy.com/img/thechessstore/Bffffff/kingmoves.jpg\" width=\"296\" height=\"296\" alt=\"Rules of Chess - How the King chess piece moves\"></font></p>\n    </td>\n    <td width=\"325\" valign=\"top\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">\n      <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0\"><b><font size=\"2\">Chess piece - King</font></b></p>\n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0\"><font size=\"2\">Having a king is\n      mandatory even though he's pretty much worthless and really nothing more\n      than a mere figure-head.

The act of &quot;castling&quot; involves two\n      chess pieces, the rook and king and there are two different ways to castle.&nbsp;\n      Rather than trying to describe the two methods (which might get\n      confusing), we'll rely on the diagrams below to guide you through the\n      correct moves.&nbsp; Now, there are special rules of chess and conditions that must exist in order to\n      castle.&nbsp; The special\n      conditions are:</font></p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <p style=\"margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10\"><font size=\"2\">Neither of the chess pieces involved, \n            your king or rook that is being castled, have been moved during the\n            chess game.</font></li>\n          <li>\n            <p style=\"margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10\"><font size=\"2\">There\n            are no other chess pieces between the king and the rook involved in the\n            castling.</font></li>\n          <li>\n            <p style=\"margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10\"><font size=\"2\">Your\n            king is not in check and neither your king or rook can be taken by\n            your opponent's next move after castling.</font></li>\n        </ul>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10\"><font size=\"2\">You\n      can castle with either of the rooks as long as these special conditions\n      are met.&nbsp; The moves involved in castling with the Queen side rook are\n      different than castling with king side rook. This is quite natural\n      given that there 2 spaces between the king and rook on the king side and\n      respectively 3 spaces on the queen side.

Promotion occurs when you\n      get a pawn clear across to the other side.&nbsp; In the same move of the\n      pawn reaches a far square, you remove the pawn and replace it with any\n      chess piece you want, that is, except a second king.&nbsp; Even if you\n      already have all of your chess pieces.&nbsp; For example, most people naturally\n      choose a queen.&nbsp; So you can have two queens, and that's quite an\n      advantage.&nbsp; But you can choose some other chess piece if you prefer, it's\n      entirely up to you.&nbsp; Here are a couple of diagrams to illustrate just\n      how promotion works:</font></p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"325\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 5;

to determine who keeps to be white.&nbsp;\n      Or, if you prefer, you can cast lots by putting a different color pawn in\n      each hand and then letting your friend choose one.&nbsp; From this point on, it's real easy,\n      white makes the first move and then you just take turns moving chess pieces and\n      trying to checkmate your opponent's king while taking as many chess pieces as you\n      can along the way.&nbsp;

Another possible\n      outcome is for one player to resign.&nbsp; A game can become so one-sided\n      (both remaining pieces and position) that the advantage is too great for\n      the other player to overcome.&nbsp; When this happens, the disadvantaged\n      player can simply call &quot;uncle&quot; and give it up.&nbsp; But don't\n      give up too easy, mistakes can always be made.&nbsp; The third possibility\n      is a draw, even though a checkmate is possible.</font></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n"

The area in the middle of the\nboard is called the bar.<br>\n<br>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n<b>Object of Game</b><br>\n<br>\nThe object of the game is to move all your checkers into your home board, and\nthen remove them from the board before your opponent does. Removing your\ncheckers is called &quot;bearing off&quot;.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Rolling the Dice</b><br>\n<br>\nTo start the game, each player rolls one die. The player who rolls the highest\nnumber gets to move first, using the numbers that were just rolled. For example,\nif white rolled 3 and black rolled 1, white starts the game with the roll 3 and\n1.<br>\n<br>\nIf both players roll the same number, re-roll.<br>\n<br>\nOn all turns after the opening roll, each player rolls their own dice. Use the\ndice cup to roll your dice. The dice must land in your right-hand side of the\nboard. If a die does not land flat (for example, cocked on a checker or the edge\nof the board), both dice must be re-rolled. This is called a &quot;cocked\ndie&quot;.<br>\n<br>\nWhen you are finished moving your checkers, pick up your dice to formally end\nyour turn. If the play you made is incomplete or illegal, your opponent may\naccept the play or require you to make a legal play. A play is deemed to have\nbeen accepted when your opponent rolls their dice or offers a double to start\ntheir turn. If you roll your dice before your opponent has picked up their dice,\nyour roll is void.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Moving the Chips</b><br>\n<br>\nOn your turn, move your checkers the number of points indicated on the dice. In\nthe diagram below, white can only move counter-clockwise toward their home\nboard. Black moves in the opposite direction.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf your opponent has two or more checkers on a point, you can't move to that\npoint. We call that point a &quot;made&quot; point.<br>\n<br>\nYou must move the numbers on the two dice separately. For example, if you roll 4\nand 2, you may move one checker 4 points and another checker 2 points. Or you\nmay move one checker a total of 6 points but only if the intermediate landing\npoint (either 4 or 2 points from the starting point) is also open.<br>\n<br>\nYou must play both dice, if possible. When only one die can be played, you must\nplay that die. If either die can be played but not both, you must play the\nlarger one. If you can't make a move with your roll, you forfeit your turn.<br>\n<br>\nIf you roll doubles you move twice the amount shown on the dice. For example, if\nyou roll double fours, you move four points, four times (not just twice).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Hitting Blots</b><br>\n<br>\nIf your opponent has only one checker on a point, you can land on that checker\nand send it to the bar. Simply pick up the checker and place it on the bar in\nthe middle of the board. One lone checker on a point is called a blot.<br>\n<br>\nIn the following diagram black has left a blot on point 10. If white rolls a 6,\nthey can move the checker from point 4 to point 10 and send the black checker to\nthe bar.<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://static.zoovy.com/img/thechessstore/-/backgammon_move_diagrams/backgammon_board_hitting_blots_357x271.jpg\" width=\"357\" height=\"271\" border=\"0\" \n>\n<br>\n<br>\nYour opponent will have to re-enter that checker before they can make any other\nmove.<br>\n<br>\nTo re-enter a checker, roll the dice on your turn as usual. Then place your\nchecker on a point in your opponent's home board corresponding to the number on\neither die. For example, if you roll 6 and 2, you can place the checker on the 6\npoint or on the 2 point, if they are open.<br>\n<br>\nIf neither of the points is open, the player loses his turn. If a player is able\nto enter some but not all of his checkers, he must enter as many as he can and\nthen forfeit the remainder of his turn. After the last of a player's checkers\nhas been entered, any unused numbers on the dice must be played, by moving\neither the checker that was entered or a different checker.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Bearing Off</b><br>\n<br>\nAfter you have moved all of your checkers into your home board, you can start to\nremove your checkers from the board. This is called bearing off.<br>\n<br>\nTo bear off, simply remove checkers from the board, corresponding to your dice\nroll. For example, if you roll 6 and 3, you can remove a checker from your 6\npoint and a checker from your 3 point.<br>\n<br>\nIf there is no checker on the point corresponding to the die, you must move a\nchecker from a higher numbered point. If there are no checkers on\nhigher-numbered points, remove a checker from the highest-numbered point that\nhas checkers.<br>\n<br>\nYou don't have to bear off a checker if you can make a legal move.<br>\n<br>\nIf your opponent hits one of your checkers when you are bearing off, you must\nbring that checker back to your home board before continuing to bear off.<br>\n<br>\nIf you bear off all your checkers before your opponent, you win.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Scoring</b><br>\n<br>\nRather than play just one game, players usually play a match of several games.\nThe winner is the first person to reach an agreed upon point total. For example,\n17 point matches are common in tournaments.<br>\n<br>\nThe winner of the game receives one point, unless the stakes were doubled or\nre-doubled during the course of the game, or the loser was &quot;gammoned&quot;\nor &quot;backgammoned&quot;.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Doubling the stakes</strong> - During the game either player may offer\nto double the stakes. To do this, pick up the doubling cube and turn it to the\nnumber &quot;2&quot;. You can only double at the start of your turn, before you\nroll the dice.<br>\n<br>\nYour opponent may accept the double, or decline it. If they accept, you continue\nto play, but now the winner of the game will receive two points instead of just\none. If they decline, the game is over and you win one point.<br>\n<br>\nIf your opponent accepts the double, your opponent &quot;owns the cube&quot;.\nThat means that only they can offer the next re-double. If, at some point in the\ngame, they re-double and you accept, you then own the cube. There is no limit to\nhow many times the stakes can be re-doubled. In the highly unusual case that\nyour re-doubles exceed 64, the maximum value displayed on the cube, keep track\nof the re-doubled value on a sheet of paper.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Gammons and backgammons</strong> - Another way to score more than a\nsingle point when you win is if you gammon or backgammon your opponent.<br>\n<br>\nIf you bear off all your checkers before your opponent can bear off at least one\nchecker, you have &quot;gammoned&quot; your opponent. A gammon scores double the\ncube value.<br>\n<br>\nIf you bear off all your checkers before your opponent can bear off at least one\nchecker, and your opponent still has a checker in your home board or on the\nboard, you have &quot;backgammoned&quot; your opponent. A backgammon usually\nscores triple the cube value. (Note: Some online sites score a backgammon as\ndouble the cube value, same as a gammon.)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Automatic doubles</strong> - If both players roll the same number on the\nopening roll, the stakes are automatically doubled and the doubling cube is\nturned to &quot;2&quot;.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Beavers</strong> - After a player doubles the stakes, the other player\nmay immediately re-double, and still keep posession of the cube.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Jacoby Rule</strong> - Under the Jacoby Rule, gammons and backgammons\nonly count as 1 point if the cube is not doubled during the game.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Crawford Rule</strong> - A rule that prohibits doubling for one game\nwhen a player is within one point of winning the match.</font></p>",
      "description" : "<p><font size=\"2\"><span class=\"texthead\"><b>Number of Players</b></span><br>\n<br>\nBackgammon is a two-person game.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Game Board</b><br>\n<br>\nA backgammon set includes a board, 15 white checkers, 15 black checkers, two\npairs of dice, two dice cups for rolling the dice, and a doubling cube.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Setting Up the Backgammon Board</b><br>\n<br>\nTo start the game, place your checkers in the positions shown in the diagram.\nPlace the doubling cube in the center. It doesn't matter who uses the white\n(light-colored) checkers and who uses the black (dark-colored) checkers.<br>\n<br>\n(insert diagram here)<br clear=\"all\">\n<br>\nThe 24 triangles on the board are called points. The area in the middle of the\nboard is called the bar.<br>\n<br>\n<br clear=\"all\">\n<b>Object of Game</b><br>\n<br>\nThe object of the game is to move all your checkers into your home board, and\nthen remove them from the board before your opponent does. Removing your\ncheckers is called &quot;bearing off&quot;.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Rolling the Dice</b><br>\n<br>\nTo start the game, each player rolls one die. The player who rolls the highest\nnumber gets to move first, using the numbers that were just rolled. For example,\nif white rolled 3 and black rolled 1, white starts the game with the roll 3 and\n1.<br>\n<br>\nIf both players roll the same number, re-roll.<br>\n<br>\nOn all turns after the opening roll, each player rolls their own dice. Use the\ndice cup to roll your dice. The dice must land in your right-hand side of the\nboard. If a die does not land flat (for example, cocked on a checker or the edge\nof the board), both dice must be re-rolled. This is called a &quot;cocked\ndie&quot;.<br>\n<br>\nWhen you are finished moving your checkers, pick up your dice to formally end\nyour turn. If the play you made is incomplete or illegal, your opponent may\naccept the play or require you to make a legal play. A play is deemed to have\nbeen accepted when your opponent rolls their dice or offers a double to start\ntheir turn. If you roll your dice before your opponent has picked up their dice,\nyour roll is void.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Moving the Chips</b><br>\n<br>\nOn your turn, move your checkers the number of points indicated on the dice.

Because boxwood has a very tight, closed grain, after the pieces are stained and polished they can nearly pass for real ebony. Only an expert could tell the difference. But the advantage of an ebonized chess set is that it's half the cost of real ebony. Our most popular chess sets are available in ebonized boxwood and we offer combinations of ebonized boxwood with the traditional unstained boxwood and also with golden rosewood for a unique combination. You will find just about any size you are looking for, from 2.75\" up to 4\" kings. These chess sets are either double or triple weighted, come with green baize pads, and include an extra set of queens for pawn promotion."

      "description" : "From the largest chess board manufacturer in the world, this Rechapados Ferrer Black Walnut and Maple Deluxe Chess Board is an attractive and practical chess board for any chess set. A favorite chess board for Golden Rosewood chess sets as the rich golden-brown colors match perfectly and black chess pieces contrast strikingly with the walnut and maple colors. A triple inlay pinstripe around the playing area along with an extra wide frame gives the chess board an elegant look. The entire chess board is sealed in a polyurethane finish that both protects and enhances the natural beauty of the wood."

Elm root is unique and colorful with brown and orange colors that intermingle creating irregular patterns. A wide black inlay defines the playing area while contrasting richly against the colors of the briar burl and maple. An extra wide frame gives the board visual balance. This chess board is an excellent choice for contrasting against ebony chess pieces but nearly any chess set will look stunning on this board."

It's pretty much common sense, the most important factor in choosing the right chess board is one that properly fits the chess pieces you are putting on it. Then, it's a matter of selecting the best color and material for the chess pieces.<br>\n<br>\nA wood chess board is by far the most popular for wood chess pieces and it's also a good choice for some metal and theme chess sets. When putting wood chess pieces and a wood chess board together there are two thoughs, either created a nice contrast between the pieces and board or match the colors as closely as possible. Most players will tend to prefer a contrast because it makes the pieces easier to see against the background colors of the board. But matching colors can create a very elegant effect which is especially desireable when you will be displaying or leaving a chess set out.<br>",

Whether it's FedEx, DHL, or UPS, they all charge for shipping. The\r\n      free shipping you see advertised is nothing more than a marketing ploy to\r\n      catch your eye. All that free shipping really means is that you don't have\r\n      a separate line item cost for shipping on your sales receipt. These stores\r\n      are simply adding the shipping cost to the price of their products. Most\r\n      people have this figured out, but not everyone.</font></p>\r\n      \r\n      <p style=\"margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\">Here\r\n      is a real life example we took from one of our competitors web site today.\r\n      They offer free shipping on everything. Their price on the Ivan II chess\r\n      computer from Excalibur Electronics in $119.99. The Chess Store price is\r\n      $79.95 - and this is our regular, everyday price. Shipping on this chess\r\n      computer will run around $10.00 plus or minus a couple of bucks depending\r\n      on the zip code. So with shipping our price is about $89.95 or $30.00 less\r\n      than our competitor that's offering free shipping. Not such a great deal\r\n      after all, is it? And we can find free shipping scams like this by the\r\n      hundreds. But to be fair, from time to time you will find a legitimate\r\n      good deal with free shipping.</font></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 10; margin-bottom: 0\"><font size=\"4\" face=\"Arial\"><b>Drop\r\nShipping - Not Done Here!</b></font></p>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"600\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\">Many\r\n      retailers and many of our competitors on the internet have never even seen\r\n      the product they're selling.

All they have is a picture and it's probably not\r\n      even theirs. There are big advantages to retailers that do this, but\r\n      there's absolutely no advantage to the consumer. If you're a retailer that\r\n      drop ships, you don't carry inventory and don't need warehouse space. And\r\n      no one to package your order either. All you need is a computer.</font>\r\n      \r\n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\">That's\r\n      not the way we do business and never will.

Because our\r\n      products are in our warehouse we can answer any question for you and can\r\n      guarantee your order will ship either same day or next business day. The\r\n      advantages don't stop here. Take our wood chess sets for example. We\r\n      inspect every chess piece of every chess set before it ships out our door.\r\n      It must pass our inspection and meet our standards. We doubt that happens\r\n      when your order ships from some third party. And we have very precise\r\n      packaging standards to make sure your order arrives safely.

That's why we won't drop ship. We've heard the horror stories.\r\n      If you're not sure if an online store you're considering drop ships or not,\r\n      pick up the phone and ask them. If you see messages on a product\r\n      description that says something like; &quot;normally ships within 3\r\n      business days&quot;, they either drop ship or they're real slow.</font>\r\n      \r\n      <p style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 5\"><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\">To\r\n      be fair, there's probably some retailers and distributors that do a decent\r\n      job working together for the customer.

Ebony is one of the hardest and most dense woods in the world - it even sinks in water. There is almost no visible grain and when finely polished it nearly turns into a piece of pure black glassy obsidian. We offer our finest Staunton chess sets in ebony matched with either boxwood or African padauk for the ultimate combination of exotic woods. All of our ebony chess sets are triple weighted and with the extra weight of the heavy ebony, results in the heaviest chess sets. You will find just about any size you are looking for, from 3\" up to 5\" kings. All of these sets come with green baize pads and include an extra set of queens for pawn promotion."
