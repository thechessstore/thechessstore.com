chess store: 
- wiki formatting not working for spec tab. - issue passed to support for the time being.
- Make corrections to the cart/checkout. Shipping list for cart added but function to show list of dynamically generated shipping options and costs. Not sure if that is even possible at this stage. - Discuss with Michael tomorrow.
- Alterations to the v-store and how GA registers a new user with the site.-- No simple fix to this issue. Will have to consult with JT on how best to change when GA counts a user as visiting the v-store.
