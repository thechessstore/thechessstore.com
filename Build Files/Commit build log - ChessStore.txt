Build Log:
**- Continued re-build of homepage category sliders to hardcoding. Awaiting Images. Links active but most categories need reorganization on the backend to display only the correct selections (i.e. The metal chess sets category brings you to a submenu that allows you to select pieces or full sets)
**- Updated mah jong and backgammon store link to "carry over" the cart between stores. Anything added to the cart in the chess store will be carried over to either vstore upon click of the link.

Client Questions:
Homepage link issues/Questions:
- Categories on homepage that do not have a category: Marble & Onyx Chess Pieces
- Categories on homepage that do not have a category but are assigned to the closest general category:Stained Wood Chess Boards, Metal Chess Boards
- Categories on homepage that do not have data: .00045-garden-chess-sets

- On the category page, under each category, there is a link called view details. What exactly did you want that to do? Did  you want that to pop up a quickview with a description of the product details or did you want that link to forward you to the product page for that product?
