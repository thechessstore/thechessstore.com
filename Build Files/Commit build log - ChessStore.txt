Question for michael:
- Is there anything in the framework already for a user wishlist?
- Assist with making sense of Jeff's podio post on the category page filtered search feature.

Questions for JT:
- Homepage horizontal sliders not displaying until scroll left or right is clicked....the event is triggered within a oncomplete, is that affecting its visibility?



Client Questions:
- On the category page, under each category, there is a link called view details. What exactly did you want that to do? Did  you want that to pop up a quickview with a description of the product details or did you want that link to forward you to the product page for that product?
