Questions for JT:


Client Questions:
Homepage link issues/Questions:
- Categories on homepage that do not have a category:
- Categories on homepage that do not have a category but are assigned to the closest general category:
- Categories on homepage that do not have data in their product page: .00045-garden-chess-sets, .00048-chess-software, .00024-marble-onyx-chess-sets.marble-onyx-chess-pieces, All of the shop by brand categories. 
- Gift Ideas downdown has no data and no links. Need some ideas for those to be built.
- Shop by brand: need to: A. Consult with senior devs on how this data can be assigned dynamically. OR B. find the categories that contain each brand specific chess sets and assign those to each link.

- Page questions: On the homepage we have links for reseller program, affiliate program, Visit our showroom, collector's club, 10% club, rules of chess, fide laws of chess, read our blog, and download our app. I'm assuming these are pages you wanted me to build for these links. The question I have is what do you want in them exactly? If they are simple in design, you can just explain them to me in text via podio. If you want something a little more stylized, you might want to get with andrea to build designs for them so that I can make you these pages.
- I need link information for the gift ideas link dropdown on the header.
- On the category page, under each category, there is a link called view details. What exactly did you want that to do? Did  you want that to pop up a quickview with a description of the product details or did you want that link to forward you to the product page for that product?
